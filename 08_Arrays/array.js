// an array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value
// An array is a data structure in JavaScript that allows you to store and access multiple values in a single variable. Each value in an array is called an element, and elements can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays.

// Here's an example of how to create an array in JavaScript:
const cars=['Saruar','Sihab','Rahim','Sabbir','Najmul'];

 cars.push('they are best friends'); 
//  it will be added in cars because of .push method
cars.length;
 console.log(cars.length);
