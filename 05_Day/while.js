// the while loop is another type of loop in js 


// while(condition){
    // code to be executed
// }

// Here's how it works
// 1 . The condition statement is evaluated before each iteration of the loop .
// if it's ture, the loop countinues; otherwise ,it ends
// 2 the code to be executed is the set of instructions that will be executed in each iteration of the loop.
// here's an example that uses  a while loop to print number from 1 to 5 ;

let i=1;
while (i<=5){
    console.log(i)
    i++;
}
